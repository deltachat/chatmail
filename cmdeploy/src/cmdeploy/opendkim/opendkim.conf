# See
# <https://www.zone.eu/blog/2024/05/17/bimi-and-dmarc-cant-save-you/>
# and RFC 6376 (page 41) for reference.
#
# We don't use "l=" body length so the problem described in RFC 6376
# is not applicable, but adding e.g. a second "From" header
# or second "Autocrypt" header is better prevented in any case.
