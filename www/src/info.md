## More information 

### Choosing a chatmail address instead of using a random one

In the Delta Chat account setup 
you may tap `LOG INTO YOUR E-MAIL ACCOUNT` 
and fill the two fields like this: 

- `Address`: invent a word with *exactly* nine characters 
   and append `@{{config.mail_domain}}` to it. 

- `Password`: invent at least 9 characters. 

If the e-mail address is not yet taken, you'll get that account. 
The first login sets your password. 


### Rate and storage limits 

- Un-encrypted messages are blocked to recipients outside
  {{config.mail_domain}} but setting up contact via [QR invite codes](https://delta.chat/en/help#howtoe2ee) 
  allows your messages to pass freely to any outside recipients.

- You may send up to 60 messages per minute

- Seen messages are removed 40 days after arriving on the server

- You can store up to [100MB messages on the server](https://delta.chat/en/help#what-happens-if-i-turn-on-delete-old-messages-from-server)


### Who are the operators? Which software is running? 

This chatmail provider is run by a small voluntary group of devs and sysadmins,
who [publically develop chatmail provider setups](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail).
Chatmail setups aim to be very low-maintenance, resource efficient and 
interoperable with any other standards-compliant e-mail service.
