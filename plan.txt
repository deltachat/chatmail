# Chat-mail server development (up until Oct 18th)

## Dovecot goals/steps

1. create-user-on-login ("doveauth")
  - repackage so that "doveauth" does not come from a hard-coded path
  - persistence of accounts

2. per-user quota (adaptive)

3. automatic expiry of messages older than M days

4. automatic expiry of users that haven't logged in for N days


## Postfix goals/steps

1. block all outgoing mails with our own LMTP program

2. only allow (outgoing) mails if secure-join or autocrypt-pgp-encrypted format
   (probably via an lmtp service)

3. basic outgoing send rate/limits (depending on "account-rating")


## online tests (first with plain python/pytest)

- write tests for dovecot login (exists)
- write tests for postfix logins
- write A<>B send/receive tests


## Delta Chat

1. qr code that defines access to a chatmail instance (like mailadm but without http etc.)

2. support for creating username/password and verifying login works
