# Privacy Policy for {{ config.mail_domain }} 

We want to show you in a fair and transparent way
what personal data is processed by us.
We follow a strict privacy-by-design approach
and try to avoid processing your data in the first place,
but as you may know,
the internet, 
and in particular sending e-mail messages,
does not work without data.
Still,
it's only fair that you know at all times
what personal data is processed
when you use our service.

If you have any remaining questions about data protection, please contact us. 

## 1. Name and contact information 

Responsible for the processing of your personal data is:
```
{{ config.privacy_postal }}
```

E-mail: {{ config.privacy_mail }}

We have appointed a data protection officer:

```
{{ config.privacy_pdo }}
```

## 2. Processing when using chat e-mail services

We provide e-mail services optimized for the use from [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat) apps 
and process only the data necessary
for the setup and technical execution of the e-mail dispatch.
The purpose of the processing is to
read, write, manage, delete, send, and receive emails.
For this purpose,
we operate server-side software
that enables us to send and receive e-mail messages.
Allowing the use of the e-mail service,
we process the following data and details:

- Outgoing and incoming messages (SMTP) are stored for transit 
  on behalf of their users until the message can be delivered.

- E-Mail-Messages are stored for the recipient and made accessible via IMAP protocols,
  until explicitly deleted by the user or until a fixed time period is exceeded,
  (*usually 4-8 weeks*).

- IMAP and SMTP protocols are password protected with unique credentials for each account.

- Users can retrieve or delete all stored messages 
  without intervention from the operators using standard IMAP client tools.

### 3.1 Account setup

Creating an account happens in one of two ways on our mail servers: 

- with a QR invitation token 
  which is scanned using the DeltaChat app
  and then the account is created.

- by letting Delta Chat otherwise create an account 
  and register it with a {{ config.mail_domain }} mail server. 

In either case, we process the newly created email address.
No phone numbers,
other email addresses,
or other identifiable data
is currently required.
The legal basis for the processing is
Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR,
as you have a usage contract with us
by using our services.

## 3.2 Processing of E-Mail-Messages

In addition,
we will process data
to keep the server infrastructure operational
for purposes of e-mail dispatch
and abuse prevention.

- Therefore,
  it is necessary to process the content and/or metadata
  (e.g., headers of the email as well as smtp chatter)
  of E-Mail-Messages in transit. 

- We will keep logs of messages in transit for a limited time.
  These logs are used to debug delivery problems and software bugs.

In addition,
we process data to protect the systems from excessive use.
Therefore, limits are enforced:

- rate limits

- storage limits

- message size limits

- any other limit neccessary for the whole server to function in a healthy way
  and to prevent abuse.

The processing and use of the above permissions
are performed to provide the service.
The data processing is necessary for the use of our services,
therefore the legal basis of the processing is
Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR,
as you have a usage contract with us
by using our services.
The legal basis for the data processing
for the purposes of security and abuse prevention is
Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest results
from the aforementioned purposes.
We will not use the collected data
for the purpose of drawing conclusions
about your person.
